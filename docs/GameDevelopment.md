## Development Philosophy

Our development approach follows these key principles:

1. **Incremental Development**: Build features in small, testable increments
2. **Component-Based Architecture**: Leverage our ECS system for clean separation of concerns
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for game features before/alongside implementation
4. **Visual Feedback Loop**: Ensure each feature has immediate visual feedback for rapid iteration
5. **Reusable Systems**: Design systems to be reusable across different game aspects

## Building and Running the Game

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- NPM (v8+)
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

### Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server with hot reloading
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Combined dev mode (server + watch tests)
npm run dev
```

### Development Workflow

1. Run `npm run dev` to start both the development server and test watcher

## Testing Strategy

Each component and system should be tested at multiple levels:

### Unit Tests

- Test individual components in isolation
- Verify component behavior under various conditions
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components
- Verify systems work together correctly
- Test game feature workflows end-to-end

### Manual Playtesting

- Verify gameplay feels good
- Check for performance issues
- Look for visual glitches
- Test on different browsers and hardware

## Required Libraries and Tools

The project already includes most necessary libraries:

- **Babylon.js**: Core 3D engine
- **Babylon.js Physics**: Already integrated

Additional libraries to consider:

- **Howler.js**: For advanced audio management (if Babylon.js audio is insufficient)
- **Cannon.js**: For advanced physics (if needed beyond what's in Babylon.js)

## Performance Considerations

Throughout development, keep these performance targets in mind:

1. **Frame Rate**: Maintain 60+ FPS on mid-range hardware
2. **Load Time**: Initial load under 5 seconds on broadband
3. **Memory Usage**: Keep under 500MB RAM
4. **Asset Size**: Optimize textures and models for web delivery

Implement the following optimizations:

1. **Level of Detail (LOD)** for distant objects
2. **Object Pooling** for projectiles and effects
3. **Frustum Culling** to avoid rendering off-screen objects
4. **Texture Atlasing** to reduce draw calls
5. **Code Splitting** to load only needed code

By following this development plan, we'll build the RunJumpSki game in logical, incremental steps, ensuring each component is properly tested and performs well before moving on to the next phase.
