# RunJumpSki Performance Analysis

## Overview
This document contains performance analysis for the RunJumpSki game engine, identified bottlenecks, and proposed optimization strategies.

## Identified Bottlenecks

### Update Loops
1. **Main Engine Update Loop** - The engine updates all systems sequentially which can lead to inefficient frame time usage.
   - Current implementation in `Engine.ts` iterates through all systems regardless of their actual update needs.
   - Systems that don't need to update every frame still get called (though some have empty implementations).

2. **Entity Update Pattern** - Each entity updates all its components in sequence.
   - The `EntityManager.update()` method calls `update()` on each entity which in turn updates its components.
   - No spatial partitioning or culling is implemented for entity updates.

3. **DebugSystem Update** - Potential overhead from debug systems that may not be necessary in production.
   - Performance monitoring and debug GUI updates could be creating unnecessary overhead.

### Physics Calculations
1. **Physics Engine Integration** - Direct coupling to Babylon.js physics may limit optimization opportunities.
   - No custom step size control for physics calculations.
   - All physics impostors are updated at the same frequency.

2. **Collision Detection** - Potential for broad-phase optimization.
   - No evidence of spatial partitioning for efficient collision detection.
   - Potential overhead from collision checking between objects that are far apart.

### Rendering System
1. **Render Pipeline** - The render loop is tightly coupled to the main update loop.
   - All rendering happens on a single thread.
   - No level-of-detail system observed for distant objects.

2. **Post-Processing Effects** - Potential overhead from post-processing effects.
   - Multiple post-processing effects may be active simultaneously without considering performance impact.
   - No adaptive quality based on current frame rate.

### Memory Management
1. **Asset Management** - No observed system for unloading unused assets.
   - Potential for memory leaks or unnecessary memory usage from unused assets.
   
2. **Object Pooling** - Limited use of object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects.
   - Projectiles, particles, and other temporary objects may cause garbage collection pauses.

## Data Structures
1. **Collection Types** - Heavy use of Maps and Arrays which may have performance implications.
   - Frequent iterations over large collections could be optimized.
   - No observed use of specialized data structures for spatial queries.

## Optimization Strategies

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Implement Object Pooling** - For frequently created/destroyed objects like particles and projectiles.
2. **Spatial Partitioning** - Implement a basic spatial partitioning system for collision detection.
3. **Asset Lifecycle Management** - Add unloading of unused assets when changing scenes or levels.
4. **System Update Prioritization** - Allow systems to specify update frequency needs.

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Rendering Optimizations** - Implement level-of-detail systems for distant objects.
2. **Physics Optimization** - Introduce variable timestep physics or fixed timestep with interpolation.
3. **Multi-threading** - Move specific systems to web workers where possible.
4. **Adaptive Quality** - Dynamically adjust rendering quality based on performance metrics.

### Long-term Architectural Changes
1. **Job System** - Replace sequential updates with a parallelizable job system.
2. **Component Batching** - Process similar components together for better cache coherency.
3. **Render Graph** - Implement a flexible render graph for optimizing the rendering pipeline.

## Performance Benchmarks
