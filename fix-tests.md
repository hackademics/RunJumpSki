# RunJumpSki Test Fixing Roadmap

## Summary

The test suite for the RunJumpSki game engine has seen significant improvement with most test modules now fully passing. These include critical components of the physics system, collision detection, core ECS functionality, camera systems, rendering effects, and utility classes. The fixes required comprehensive improvements to our mocking strategy, particularly for the Babylon.js integration, with special attention to matrix operations, vector calculations, physics simulation, camera management, and post-processing effects.

### Most Recent Fix: PlayerPhysics Sliding Test
- The "should accelerate downhill when sliding" test is now passing
- This test verifies the important physics mechanism where players accelerate when sliding down steep slopes
- Fixed by ensuring proper calculation of slide acceleration based on slope normal vector
- The sliding physics mechanism uses gravity projection onto the surface plane
- Steeper slopes generate greater acceleration with a minimum friction applied
- The test confirms our core downhill acceleration math is correct

## Remaining Test Challenges

### High Priority Issues

#### SpatialPartitioningCollisionSystem
- Located at an unusual path (src/core/physics/ instead of tests/unit/)
- Needs to be moved to proper test directory and integrated with test runner
- Currently has implementation but fails to run properly as a test
- 4 failing tests with issue: BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor constructor not available in tests
- Fix: Create proper mock implementation for PhysicsImpostor
- Priority: High - Spatial partitioning is essential for performance with many entities

#### TerrainRenderer Tests (6 failing tests)
- Issue: Mock implementation for BABYLON.Mesh.CreateGroundFromHeightMap is missing
- Fix: Implement proper mocking for BABYLON.Mesh static methods
- Priority: High - Terrain rendering is a fundamental part of our game

### Medium Priority Issues

#### ControlsManager Tests (8 failing tests)
- Issue: GameInputMapper initialization failing with contextBindings.has not a function
- Fix: Implement proper Map object mocking for contextBindings
- Priority: Medium - Controls are critical for gameplay

#### RenderingSystem Tests (2 failing tests)
- Issue: DOM manipulation issues with canvas element and engine.stopRenderLoop not being called
- Fix: Improve mocking of DOM elements and BabylonJS engine
- Priority: Medium

#### Event System Tests
- Issue: Module import errors with EventDispatcher
- Fix: Fix import paths or create proper mocks
- Priority: Medium - Events are central to game communication

#### Engine Tests
- Issue: Module import errors
- Fix: Correct module paths or implement better test configuration
- Priority: Medium - Engine is the core of the system

#### SceneManager Tests
- Issue: BabylonJS GUI registration issues
- Fix: Implement proper mocks for BabylonJS GUI

### Low Priority Issues

#### TweakableParameter Tests (9 failing tests)
- Issue: Vector3 component handling and numeric range validation
- Fix: Properly mock Vector3 and fix parameter initialization
- Priority: Low - Debugging tools only

#### MovementController Tests
- Add missing tests
- Priority: Low - Core movement is already tested in PlayerPhysics

## SpatialPartitioningCollisionSystem Test Plan
1. Migrate the tests from src to tests/unit/core/physics directory
2. Update import paths to match the test environment
3. Enhance mock implementations for BABYLON.Scene and BABYLON.PhysicsImpostor
4. Fix the spatial grid cell management tests
5. Improve performance comparison tests

The SpatialPartitioningCollisionSystem is essential for optimizing collision detection with many entities, particularly in large open worlds. Proper testing will ensure it correctly manages spatial partitioning and significantly improves performance over brute-force approaches.

## Standardizing Mock Implementation

A key challenge identified in our test fixes is inconsistent Babylon.js mock implementations. We will create a centralized mock library:

### Mock Library Structure
1. Create a `/tests/mocks/babylonjs.ts` file that provides:
   - Core classes: Vector3, Matrix, Quaternion with all required methods
   - Mesh, Scene, Engine implementations
   - PhysicsImpostor with proper behavior
   - Asset loading mocks

### Mock Implementation Requirements
- Type-safe implementations matching Babylon.js interfaces
- Proper state management and object references
- Chainable methods maintaining proper state
- Event handling simulation
- Integration with Jest's mocking system

## Common Issues and Solutions

### BabylonJS Mocking Issues
- Missing methods and properties in mock objects
- Incorrect implementation of complex methods like matrix decomposition
- Need for properly typed mock objects

**Solution**: Create comprehensive mocks with all required methods and properties

### Import Path Issues
- Problems with '@core/' alias in tests
- Module resolution failures in test environment

**Solution**: Fix module aliasing in Jest configuration or use relative paths

### Type Errors
- Incorrect typing of mock objects
- Issues with accessing protected/private members during testing

**Solution**: Implement proper interfaces in mock objects and use type assertions where needed

### Mock Implementation Issues
- Incomplete mock implementations causing runtime errors
- Lack of proper testing utilities for complex objects

**Solution**: Implement full mock functionality with proper method chains and state management

## Testing Strategy

1. **Mock Improvements**:
   - Create a centralized mock library for BabylonJS objects
   - Implement consistent Vector3, Matrix, and Quaternion mocks
   - Create standard mocks for scene, engine, and physics objects

2. **Test Structure Improvements**:
   - Ensure consistent use of beforeEach and afterEach for setup/teardown
   - Standardize mocking approach across test files
   - Add more descriptive test names and failure messages

3. **Coverage Goals**:
   - Target 90%+ coverage for core physics and player movement
   - Target 80%+ coverage for rendering and asset management
   - Target 70%+ coverage for UI and auxiliary systems

## Next Steps

1. **Fix SpatialPartitioningCollisionSystem Tests**:
   - Create proper PhysicsImpostor mock implementation
   - Move the tests to the correct location
   - Fix spatial grid cell management tests

2. **Fix TerrainRenderer Tests**:
   - Implement Mesh.CreateGroundFromHeightMap mock
   - Ensure proper vertex data handling

3. **Address SkiingPhysics Skipped Test**:
   - Investigate and fix the uphill deceleration test that is currently skipped

4. **Address PlayerPhysics Skipped Tests**:
   - Fix the remaining tests for jetpack transitions

5. **Create Centralized Babylon.js Mock Library**:
   - Implement consistent Vector3, Matrix, and Quaternion mocks
   - Create standard mocks for scene, engine, and physics objects

6. **Fix Medium Priority Tests**:
   - ControlsManager
   - RenderingSystem
   - EventSystem
   - Engine
   - SceneManager

## Conclusion

With the majority of critical tests now passing, we have a solid foundation for ensuring the stability and correctness of the RunJumpSki game engine. The remaining test issues are well-understood, and we have a clear roadmap for addressing them. By implementing centralized Babylon.js mocking and standardizing our test approach, we can achieve a robust test suite that ensures our game mechanics work correctly and remain stable during development.

The test fixes completed so far have significantly improved the reliability of the core physics, collision detection, and player movement systems, which are fundamental to the gameplay experience. With continued focus on fixing the remaining tests, we will have comprehensive coverage of all engine components, ensuring a stable and well-tested game engine.
