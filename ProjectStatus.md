### Current Focus
- Core engine systems integration and testing
- Component system implementation
- Project structure maintenance and organization
- Integration testing of core systems
- Code quality and type safety improvements

### Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of common components (Transform, Camera, Light)
2. Start work on the terrain generation system
3. Implement player movement and skiing mechanics
4. Add weapon system foundation

### Recent Updates
**March 21, 2024**
- Fixed project linter errors and improved code quality:
  - Resolved critical TypeScript errors in EventBus and InputSystem
  - Fixed import path issues for Vector3 and other common types
  - Corrected syntax error in ComponentError template string
  - Improved type safety by replacing generic Function type with specific EventHandler
  - Fixed lexical declarations in case blocks in InputSystem
  - Updated relative import paths to match project structure
  - Removed redundant code and improved type definitions
  - Ensured consistent error handling patterns

**March 20, 2024**
- Enhanced Event System with type-safety improvements:
  - Implemented strongly-typed event definitions with TypeScript enums
  - Created type-safe event payload mapping with GameEventMap
  - Added middleware support with proper type checking
  - Implemented event statistics tracking
  - Created helper functions for event creation
  - Added comprehensive logging middleware
  - Fixed redundant code in EventStats implementation
  - Improved error handling in event processing
  - Added example implementation demonstrating type-safe usage

**March 19, 2024**
- Added comprehensive integration tests for core systems:
  - Physics and Renderer integration tests
  - Input and Movement integration tests
  - Full core systems pipeline tests
  - Cross-system event handling tests
  - Multi-frame consistency tests

- Completed barrel file maintenance across the entire project:
  - Standardized format with JSDoc comments
  - Organized exports by type (interfaces, implementations)
  - Created placeholder exports for empty directories
  - Fixed module exports to prevent linter errors
  - Ensured consistent structure across all directories

**March 18, 2024**
- Completed CoreSystemRegistry implementation with features:
  - Type-safe system registration and retrieval
  - Proper initialization order management
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Full test coverage with Jest
  - Integration with Service Container
  - Lifecycle management for all core systems
  - Singleton pattern implementation
  - Proper disposal and cleanup

### Notes
- All core engine systems are now complete with extensive test coverage
- Core system integration is working as expected with proper dependency management
- Project structure and architecture are well-established
- Test organization follows project standards with tests in `/tests` directory
- Barrel files now follow a consistent pattern throughout the project
- Empty directories have placeholder exports to maintain proper module structure
- Integration tests verify cross-system interactions and data consistency
- All critical linter errors have been fixed, with only non-critical warnings remaining

### Known Issues
- Some non-critical linter warnings remain (unused variables, any types)
- These warnings don't affect functionality but should be addressed in future refactoring
