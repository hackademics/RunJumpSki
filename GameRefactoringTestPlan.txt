# Game Refactoring Test Plan

This document outlines the testing strategy for our game refactoring efforts to ensure we maintain functionality and don't introduce regressions.

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing
- **Purpose**: Test individual components and functions in isolation
- **Tools**: Jest/Mocha for TypeScript
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage for refactored code
- **Priority Areas**:
  - Utility functions (UUID, Logger)
  - Strategy pattern implementations
  - Command pattern implementations
  - Physics calculations
  - State transitions

### 2. Integration Testing
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between components
- **Tools**: Custom test harness
- **Priority Areas**:
  - Movement system + Physics system
  - Input system + Command system
  - Event system + Observers
  - State transitions between different movement states

### 3. System Testing
- **Purpose**: Test the entire game system
- **Tools**: Manual testing with debug overlays
- **Priority Areas**:
  - Performance benchmarks (before/after)
  - Memory usage
  - Frame rate stability
  - Input responsiveness

## Testing Approach

### Regression Testing
For each refactored component:
1. Capture baseline behavior before refactoring
2. Create test cases that verify this behavior
3. Run tests after refactoring to ensure behavior is preserved

### Performance Testing
For performance-critical components:
1. Benchmark performance before refactoring
2. Implement optimizations during refactoring
3. Benchmark after refactoring to verify improvements

### Visual Testing
For movement and visual components:
1. Record gameplay before refactoring
2. Compare with gameplay after refactoring
3. Verify visual consistency

## Test Cases by Component

### 1. UUID Generation
- Test uniqueness across 10,000+ generations
- Test type safety with generic parameters
- Test performance (generations per second)

### 2. Logger Configuration
- Test configuration persistence
- Test log level filtering
- Test reset functionality

### 3. Movement Strategies
- Test each strategy in isolation
- Test transitions between strategies
- Test edge cases (e.g., transitioning while in air)

### 4. Event System
- Test event propagation
- Test typed event handling
- Test performance with many listeners

### 5. Physics System
- Test collision detection accuracy
- Test physics calculations precision
- Test performance with many entities

## Continuous Integration

- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run integration tests on feature branch completion
- Run system tests before merging to main branch

## Test Reporting

- Generate coverage reports after test runs
- Document any failing tests with screenshots/recordings
- Track performance metrics over time
