## API Consistency (Completed)

### Method Naming Conventions Review
- [x] Audit verb usage patterns
  - Use `get`/`set` for property access (e.g., `getPosition`/`setPosition`)
  - Use `create` for factory methods (e.g., `createScene`, `createCamera`)
  - Use `initialize` for setup methods (not `init` or `setup`)
  - Use `dispose` for cleanup (not `destroy` or `cleanup`)
  - Use `update` for frame-by-frame operations
- [x] Document exceptions to standard patterns
  - Created `docs/ApiConsistency.md` with comprehensive guidelines
  - Documented forbidden prefixes and alternatives
- [x] Create automated linting rules
  - Created `scripts/eslint-api-consistency.js` with rules for method naming
  - Created `scripts/analyze-api-consistency.ps1` for codebase analysis

### Option Objects Standardization
- [x] Analyze current option object patterns
  - Default option constants use `DEFAULT_CLASSNAME_OPTIONS` naming convention
  - Option interfaces follow `ClassNameOptions` pattern
  - Options should be grouped by component and function
- [x] Standardize default option merging
  - Created `src/core/utils/OptionsUtil.ts` with `mergeWithDefaults` function
  - Documented deep merging pattern in `docs/ApiConsistency.md`
  - Added support for nested options with proper type safety
- [x] Implement type validation
  - Added `validateOptions` to `OptionsUtil` for runtime validation
  - Created helper methods for common validation patterns
  - Documented validation approach in guidelines

### Public/Private API Boundary Audit
- [x] Review access modifier usage
  - Public methods should be documented with JSDoc
  - Protected methods should be used for extensibility points
  - Private fields and methods should be properly encapsulated
- [x] Identify inconsistent access patterns
  - Added detection in `analyze-api-consistency.ps1` script
  - Added ESLint rule for checking public methods without JSDoc
  - Added detection for private methods that should be protected
- [x] Implement access control improvements
  - Added guidelines for TypeScript's private fields (`#fieldName`)
  - Created documentation on interface separation in `ApiConsistency.md`
  - Added section on extensibility patterns in guidelines

### CI/CD Integration
- [x] Add API consistency checking to CI/CD
  - Created `.github/workflows/api-consistency.yml` workflow
  - Added ESLint plugin to CI/CD checks
  - Set up automatic report generation

### Developer Documentation
- [x] Create developer guides
  - Created `docs/DeveloperGuide-APIConsistency.md` with practical guidelines
  - Added examples of proper implementation
  - Documented common mistakes to avoid

## Notes
- Core engine architecture is solid but lacks specific game components
- Skiing and jetpack mechanics are central to gameplay and should be prioritized
- Physics implementation is crucial for skiing mechanics
- A task/feature tracking system for development would be beneficial
- Consider developing a map editor tool once core gameplay is working
