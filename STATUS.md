## Code Quality Review Results

Before proceeding with game development tasks, a thorough code review was conducted to ensure our core engine is optimized and error-free. The following issues were identified:

### API Consistency Issues

- [x] Method naming inconsistencies
  - Multiple instances of `destroy()` methods that should be renamed to `dispose()` according to our API guidelines
  - Several classes use `init()` instead of `initialize()` for initialization methods
  - These need to be systematically addressed throughout the codebase

### Type Safety Issues

- [ ] Excessive use of `any` type
  - Numerous instances of `any` type usage across the codebase, particularly in test files
  - Some core methods in the engine also use `any` types which should be replaced with proper types
  - Need to create specific interface types for better type safety

### Unfinished Work

- [ ] TODOs in codebase
  - `src/core/debug/visual/PlayerPhysicsVisualizer.ts`: Add GUI text visualization for movement state
  - `src/core/physics/PooledProjectilePhysics.ts` and `ProjectilePhysics.ts`: Add particle effects for explosion
  - `src/core/ecs/components/PhysicsComponent.ts`: Handle scaling changes properly
  - These TODOs should be addressed before finalizing the core engine

### Logging Issues

- [ ] Inconsistent logging
  - Many direct uses of `console.log`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` instead of using the Logger system
  - Need to replace all direct console calls with the Logger system for consistent logging
  - Critical for production code to have proper logging mechanisms

### Error Handling Improvements

- [ ] Inconsistent error handling
  - Some methods don't properly validate inputs or handle potential errors
  - Missing try/catch blocks in some critical sections
  - Better error messaging needed for debugging

### Performance Considerations

- [ ] Physics and collision system optimizations
  - Spatial partitioning implementation needs broader usage
  - Physics calculations could be optimized for specific game scenarios
  - Consider implementing different physics quality levels for performance scaling
  - Need to optimize terrain collision calculations which are currently expensive

- [ ] Rendering optimizations
  - Terrain rendering LOD system needs fine-tuning
  - Particle effects should scale based on device performance
  - Post-processing effects need quality scaling options
  - Consider implementing frustum culling more aggressively

- [ ] Memory usage optimization
  - Object pooling should be expanded to more object types
  - Texture memory usage needs optimization, especially for terrain
  - Consider implementing async loading for resources
  - Profile memory usage during gameplay scenarios

### Code Workarounds

- [ ] Temporary workarounds in code
  - `src/core/physics/ProjectilePhysics.ts`: Cast as PhysicsImpostor as a workaround
  - `src/core/ecs/components/PhysicsComponent.ts`: Workaround for applying force
  - These should be replaced with proper implementations

### Testing Gaps

- [ ] Incomplete test coverage
  - Some complex components lack comprehensive tests
  - Edge cases not fully tested in physics and collision systems
  - Need more integration tests between systems

### Memory Management Issues

- [ ] Inconsistent resource cleanup
  - Some components use `dispose()` method, while others use `destroy()`
  - Several components miss proper cleanup of BABYLON.js resources
  - Event listeners not always removed when components are disposed
  - Potential memory leaks in long-running applications

- [ ] Missing resource tracking
  - Some managers don't track all created resources for proper cleanup
  - Particle systems and meshes sometimes not properly disposed
  - Texture resources not always properly managed
  - Lack of central resource tracking system

- [ ] Lifecycle management
  - Components' lifecycle not always properly handled
  - Scene transitions might leave resources in memory
  - Need to implement comprehensive resource tracking
  - Consider implementing object pooling more broadly
