## Next Steps Priority

1. ✅ Implement core ECS components (Transform, Renderable, Physics)
   - TransformComponent completed ✅
   - Camera Components completed ✅
   - Next: Renderable Components
2. Develop player controller with basic movement
3. Complete physics system for collision detection
4. Create skiing and jetpack mechanics
5. Implement basic weapon systems
6. Design first playable map
7. Add targets and turrets
8. Implement basic HUD elements
9. Create start-to-finish gameplay loop

## Notes

- Core engine architecture is solid but lacks specific game components
- Need to prioritize skiing and jetpack mechanics as they are central to gameplay
- Physics implementation will be crucial for the skiing mechanics
- Should implement a task/feature tracking system for development
- Consider developing an editor tool for map design once core gameplay is working
