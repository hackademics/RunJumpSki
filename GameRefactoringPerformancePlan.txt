# Game Refactoring Performance Benchmarking Plan

This document outlines the approach for measuring performance before, during, and after the refactoring process to ensure we're making improvements rather than introducing performance regressions.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Frame Rate
- **Metric**: Frames per second (FPS)
- **Target**: Maintain 60+ FPS on target hardware
- **Measurement Method**: Rolling average over 60 seconds during gameplay
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Idle scene (baseline)
  - Normal gameplay
  - High-intensity gameplay (many entities, effects)

### 2. Memory Usage
- **Metric**: Peak and average memory consumption (MB)
- **Target**: Reduce or maintain current memory footprint
- **Measurement Method**: Memory profiling during 5-minute gameplay session
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - After initialization
  - During continuous gameplay
  - After level transitions

### 3. CPU Utilization
- **Metric**: Percentage of CPU usage per system
- **Target**: Reduce CPU usage in high-intensity scenarios
- **Measurement Method**: CPU profiling during gameplay
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Physics calculations
  - Collision detection
  - Movement state transitions

### 4. Load Times
- **Metric**: Time to initialize systems (ms)
- **Target**: Reduce or maintain current load times
- **Measurement Method**: Timestamped logging
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Initial game load
  - Level transitions
  - Asset loading

### 5. Input Responsiveness
- **Metric**: Time from input to visible action (ms)
- **Target**: <16ms (less than one frame at 60 FPS)
- **Measurement Method**: High-speed capture and frame analysis
- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Jump action
  - Direction changes
  - State transitions

## Benchmarking Process

### Pre-Refactoring Baseline
1. Create automated test scenarios for each KPI
2. Run each test 10 times and record average results
3. Document baseline performance metrics
4. Save performance profiles for later comparison

### During Refactoring
1. After each major component is refactored, run relevant benchmarks
2. Compare results to baseline
3. If performance degrades, identify and address issues before continuing
4. Document incremental changes

### Post-Refactoring Validation
1. Run complete benchmark suite
2. Compare final results to baseline
3. Document improvements and any remaining performance concerns
4. Create performance visualization charts for comparison

## Performance Hotspots to Monitor

### 1. Physics System
- **Current Issues**: 
  - Collision detection is computationally expensive
  - Physics calculations not optimized for skiing mechanics
- **Expected Improvements**:
  - 15-20% reduction in CPU usage through modularization
  - More efficient collision detection algorithms
  - Caching of frequently used calculations

### 2. Movement State Transitions
- **Current Issues**:
  - State transitions cause frame drops
  - Redundant calculations during transitions
- **Expected Improvements**:
  - Smoother transitions through interpolation
  - Reduced CPU spikes during state changes
  - Better memory usage patterns

### 3. Event System
- **Current Issues**:
  - Event propagation creates garbage collection pressure
  - Unoptimized event handlers
- **Expected Improvements**:
  - Reduced memory allocations through object pooling
  - More efficient event filtering
  - Prioritized event handling

### 4. Input Processing
- **Current Issues**:
  - Input handling creates unnecessary object allocations
  - Redundant processing of input events
- **Expected Improvements**:
  - Command pattern reduces allocations
  - More direct input-to-action mapping
  - Reduced input latency

## Profiling Tools

1. **Chrome DevTools Performance Tab**
   - For overall JavaScript performance analysis
   - Memory allocation tracking
   - CPU profiling

2. **Custom In-Game Profiler**
   - Real-time FPS counter
   - System-specific timing information
   - Memory usage visualization

3. **Automated Benchmark Suite**
   - Scripted gameplay scenarios
   - Consistent test environment
   - Results logging and comparison

## Reporting

After each benchmarking session:
1. Generate performance report with comparisons to baseline
2. Highlight improvements and regressions
3. Provide recommendations for further optimization
4. Update performance tracking dashboard
