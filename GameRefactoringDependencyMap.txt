# Game Refactoring Dependency Map

This document visualizes the dependencies between refactoring tasks to help with planning and execution.

## Critical Path Analysis

The critical path for completing the refactoring is:

1. Utility Enhancements (1.1, 1.2) - These have no dependencies and can be done first
2. Design Patterns (2.1, 2.2, 2.3) - These form the foundation for other changes
3. Modularization (3.1, 3.2) - These depend on design patterns being implemented
4. Player Movement Enhancements (4.1, 4.2, 4.3) - These depend on design patterns and modularization
5. Testing and Validation (5.1, 5.2) - These depend on all previous tasks
6. Documentation and Cleanup (6.1, 6.2) - These should be done last

## Parallel Work Opportunities

Tasks that can be worked on in parallel:

1. **Group 1** (No dependencies):
   - 1.1 UUID Generation
   - 1.2 Logger Configuration

2. **Group 2** (After Group 1):
   - 2.1 Strategy Pattern
   - 2.2 Observer Pattern
   - 2.3 Command Pattern
   - 3.1 Physics Calculations

3. **Group 3** (After Strategy Pattern):
   - 3.2 State Handlers
   - 4.2 Visual/Audio Feedback
   - 4.3 Energy Management

4. **Group 4** (After State Handlers):
   - 4.1 Smooth Transitions

## Risk Assessment

High-risk tasks that may require extra attention:

1. **Strategy Pattern for Movement States** (2.1)
   - Core gameplay functionality
   - Many dependencies
   - Complex state transitions

2. **Physics Calculations and Collision Detection** (3.1)
   - Performance-critical
   - Complex mathematics
   - Potential for subtle bugs

3. **Smooth Transitions and Responsive Controls** (4.1)
   - Directly affects player experience
   - Requires fine-tuning
   - Depends on multiple other systems
